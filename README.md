# SPICE stew: Spice Pointing Inference and Correction Exploiting the Spice Toolkit to Eliminate Wobbles

Tools to correct the pointing of SolarOrbiter/SPICE using data from the SPICE
toolkit.

## Installation

### Prerequisite: Solar Orbiter SPICE Kernels

The [SPICE kernels for Solar Orbiter][solo-spice-kernels] are required in order
to compute the pointing of SPICE.

The easiest way to install them and keep them up to date is to clone ESA's git
repository (~1Â GiB) to a location of your choice:

```
git clone https://repos.cosmos.esa.int/socci/scm/spice_kernels/solar-orbiter.git /path/to/spice_kernels/SOLAR-ORBITER/
```

Then, set the `$SPICE_KERNELS_SOLO` environment variable to point to this path.
This can be done by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:

```
export SPICE_KERNELS_SOLO=/path/to/spice_kernels/SOLAR-ORBITER/kernels
```

### SPICE stew

To install the SPICE stew package, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/gpelouze/spice_stew
pip install --user spice_stew
```


## Usage

### From the command line

Use the `spice_stew` command in the terminal, eg:

```
spice_stew /archive/SOLAR-ORBITER/SPICE/fits/level2/2021/09/14/solo_L2_spice-n-ras_20210914T025031_V03_67109159-000.fits -O ~/spice_stew_test/ --plot-results
```

Run `spice_stew -h` for more options.


### In Python

Use the `spice_stew.correct_spice_pointing` function, eg:

```
import spice_stew
ssp = spice_stew.SpiceSpicePointing()
spice_stew.correct_spice_pointing(
    ssp,
    '/archive/SOLAR-ORBITER/SPICE/fits/level2/2021/09/14/solo_L2_spice-n-ras_20210914T025031_V03_67109159-000.fits',
    '~/spice_stew_test/',
    plot_results=True,
    )
```
